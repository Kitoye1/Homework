                LETTER OF APPLICATION

             <h5>
                I am writing to express my keen interest in the 
                Font end Engineer position at Google, as advertised. 
                With a solid background and hands on experience 
                in HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT and
                also JS REACT, I am 
                confident in my ability to contribute
                meaningfully to Google’s mission of
                organizing the world’s information 
                and making it universally accessible 
                and useful.
             </h5>
             <h6>
                In my previous role at Starlink,
                I successfully developed scalable applications, 
                optimized system efficiency, led cross-functional
                teams, or improved user engagement metrics.
                These accomplishments not only strengthened 
                my technical expertise but also enhanced 
                my ability to collaborate within innovative 
                and fast-paced environments—qualities I know 
                are essential at Google. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my
               skills and experiences align with your needs. 
               I am available at your convenience for an interview
               and can be reached at danielopeyemi59@gmail.com. Thank you for 
               considering my application, and I look forward to
               the possibility of joining your team.
             </h6>
             <p>
               Yours sincerly, <br>
               Akintoye opeyemi.
